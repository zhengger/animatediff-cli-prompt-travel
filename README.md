# AnimateDiff prompt travel

[AnimateDiff](https://github.com/guoyww/AnimateDiff) with prompt travel + [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet) + [IP-Adapter](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter)

I added a experimental feature to animatediff-cli to change the prompt in the middle of the frame.

It seems to work surprisingly well!

### Example
- [A command to automate video stylization has been added](https://github.com/s9roll7/animatediff-cli-prompt-travel#video-stylization).
- Original / First generation result / Second generation(for upscaling) result
- It took 4 minutes to generate the first one and about 5 minutes to generate the second one (on rtx 4090).
- more example [here](https://github.com/s9roll7/animatediff-cli-prompt-travel/issues/29)

<br>

- Numbered from left to right.
- 1.prompt + lora
- 2.prompt + lora + IP-Adapter(scale 0.5)
- 3.prompt + lora + IP-Adapter Plus(scale 0.5)
- 4.prompt + lora + Controlnet Reference Only(style_fidelity 0)
- input image

- In the latest version, generation can now be controlled more precisely through prompts.

### Installation(for windows)
Same as the original animatediff-cli  
[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) and git client must be installed  
(A few days ago, PyTorch 2.1 was released, but it is safer to install the older version until things settle down.   
[#87](https://github.com/s9roll7/animatediff-cli-prompt-travel/issues/87))
```sh
git clone https://github.com/s9roll7/animatediff-cli-prompt-travel.git
cd animatediff-cli
py -3.10 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pip install xformers

# If you want to use the 'stylize' command, you will also need
python -m pip install -e .[stylize]

# If you want to use use dwpose as a preprocessor for controlnet_openpose, you will also need
python -m pip install -e .[dwpose]
# (DWPose is a more powerful version of Openpose)
```

venv\Scripts\activate.bat // windows
source venv/bin/activate // linux/mac


# with this setup, it took about a minute to generate in my environment(RTX4090). VRAM usage was 6-7 GB
# width 256 / height 384 / length 128 frames / context 16 frames
animatediff generate -c config/prompts/prompt_travel.json -W 256 -H 384 -L 128 -C 16
# 5min / 9-10GB
animatediff generate -c config/prompts/prompt_travel.json -W 512 -H 768 -L 128 -C 16

# upscale using controlnet (tile, line anime, ip2p, ref)
# specify the directory of the frame generated in the above step
# default config path is 'frames_dir/../prompt.json'
# here, width=512 is specified, but even if the original size is 512, it is effective in increasing detail
animatediff tile-upscale PATH_TO_TARGET_FRAME_DIRECTORY -c config/prompts/prompt_travel.json -W 512

# upscale width to 768 (smoother than tile-upscale)
animatediff refine PATH_TO_TARGET_FRAME_DIRECTORY -W 768

# change lora and prompt to make minor changes to the video.
animatediff refine PATH_TO_TARGET_FRAME_DIRECTORY -c config/prompts/some_minor_changed.json
```

#### Video Stylization
```sh
cd animatediff-cli
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# If you want to use the 'stylize' command, additional installation required
python -m pip install -e .[stylize]

# create config file from src video
animatediff stylize create-config YOUR_SRC_MOVIE_FILE.mp4

# Edit the config file by referring to the hint displayed in the log when the command finishes
# It is recommended to specify a short length for the test run

# generate(test run)
# 16 frames
animatediff stylize generate STYLYZE_DIR -L 16
# 16 frames from the 200th frame
animatediff stylize generate STYLYZE_DIR -L 16 -FO 200

# If generation takes an unusually long time, there is not enough vram.
# Give up large size or reduce the size of the context.

# generate
animatediff stylize generate STYLYZE_DIR
```


#### Auto config generation for [Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper](https://github.com/butaixianran/Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper) user
```sh
# This command parses the *.civitai.info files and automatically generates config files
# See "animatediff civitai2config -h" for details
animatediff civitai2config PATH_TO_YOUR_A111_LORA_DIR
```
#### Wildcard
- you can pick wildcard up at [civitai](https://civitai.com/models/23799/freecards). then, put them in /wildcards. 
- Usage is the same as a1111.(  \_\_WILDCARDFILENAME\_\_ format, 
ex.  \_\_animal\_\_ for animal.txt. \_\_background-color\_\_ for background-color.txt.)
```json
  "prompt_map": {           # __WILDCARDFILENAME__
    "0":  "__character-posture__, __character-gesture__, __character-emotion__, masterpiece, best quality, a beautiful and detailed portriat of muffet, monster girl,((purple body:1.3)), __background__",
```
### Recommended setting
- checkpoint : [mistoonAnime_v20](https://civitai.com/models/24149/mistoonanime) for anime, [xxmix9realistic_v40](https://civitai.com/models/47274) for photoreal
- scheduler : "k_dpmpp_sde"
- upscale : Enable controlnet_tile and controlnet_ip2p only. If you can provide a good reference image, controlnet_ref may also be useful.

### Recommended settings for 8-12 GB of vram
- max_samples_on_vram : Set to 0 if vram is insufficient when using controlnet
- max_models_on_vram : 1
- Generate at lower resolution and upscale to higher resolution
```sh
animatediff generate -c config/prompts/your_config.json -W 384 -H 576 -L 48 -C 16
animatediff tile-upscale output/2023-08-25T20-00-00-sample-mistoonanime_v20/00-341774366206100 -W 512
```

### Limitations
- lora support is limited. Not all formats can be used!!!
- It is not possible to specify lora in the prompt.

# animatediff
[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/neggles/animatediff-cli/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/neggles/animatediff-cli/main)

animatediff refactor, ~~because I can.~~ with significantly lower VRAM usage.

Also, **infinite generation length support!** yay!

# LoRA loading is ABSOLUTELY NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!

This can theoretically run on CPU, but it's not recommended. Should work fine on a GPU, nVidia or otherwise,
but I haven't tested on non-CUDA hardware. Uses PyTorch 2.0 Scaled-Dot-Product Attention (aka builtin xformers)
by default, but you can pass `--xformers` to force using xformers if you *really* want.

### How To Use

1. Lie down
2. Try not to cry
3. Cry a lot

### but for real?

Okay, fine. But it's still a little complicated and there's no webUI yet.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/neggles/animatediff-cli
cd animatediff-cli
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# install Torch. Use whatever your favourite torch version >= 2.0.0 is, but, good luck on non-nVidia...
python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# install the rest of all the things (probably! I may have missed some deps.)
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
# you should now be able to
animatediff --help
# There's a nice pretty help screen with a bunch of info that'll print here.
```

From here you'll need to put whatever checkpoint you want to use into `data/models/sd`, copy
one of the prompt configs in `config/prompts`, edit it with your choices of prompt and model (model
paths in prompt .json files are **relative to `data/`**, e.g. `models/sd/vanilla.safetensors`), and
off you go.

Then it's something like (for an 8GB card):
```sh
animatediff generate -c 'config/prompts/waifu.json' -W 576 -H 576 -L 128 -C 16
```
You may have to drop `-C` down to 8 on cards with less than 8GB VRAM, and you can raise it to 20-24
on cards with more. 24 is max.

N.B. generating 128 frames is _**slow...**_

## RiFE!

I have added experimental support for [rife-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan)
using the `animatediff rife interpolate` command. It has fairly self-explanatory help, and it has
been tested on Linux, but I've **no idea** if it'll work on Windows.

Either way, you'll need ffmpeg installed on your system and present in PATH, and you'll need to
download the rife-ncnn-vulkan release for your OS of choice from the GitHub repo (above). Unzip it, and
place the extracted folder at `data/rife/`. You should have a `data/rife/rife-ncnn-vulkan` executable, or `data\rife\rife-ncnn-vulkan.exe` on Windows.

You'll also need to reinstall the repo/package with:
```py
python -m pip install -e '.[rife]'
```
or just install `ffmpeg-python` manually yourself.

Default is to multiply each frame by 8, turning an 8fps animation into a 64fps one, then encode
that to a 60fps WebM. (If you pick GIF mode, it'll be 50fps, because GIFs are cursed and encode
frame durations as 1/100ths of a second).

Seems to work pretty well...

## TODO:

In no particular order:

- [x] Infinite generation length support
- [x] RIFE support for motion interpolation (`rife-ncnn-vulkan` isn't the greatest implementation)
- [x] Export RIFE interpolated frames to a video file (webm, mp4, animated webp, hevc mp4, gif, etc.)
- [x] Generate infinite length animations on a 6-8GB card (at 512x512 with 8-frame context, but hey it'll do)
- [x] Torch SDP Attention (makes xformers optional)
- [x] Support for `clip_skip` in prompt config
- [x] Experimental support for `torch.compile()` (upstream Diffusers bugs slow this down a little but it's still zippy)
- [x] Batch your generations with `--repeat`! (e.g. `--repeat 10` will repeat all your prompts 10 times)
- [x] Call the `animatediff.cli.generate()` function from another Python program without reloading the model every time
- [x] Drag remaining old Diffusers code up to latest (mostly)
- [ ] Add a webUI (maybe, there are people wrapping this already so maybe not?)
- [ ] img2img support (start from an existing image and continue)
- [ ] Stop using custom modules where possible (should be able to use Diffusers for almost all of it)
- [ ] Automatic generate-then-interpolate-with-RIFE mode
